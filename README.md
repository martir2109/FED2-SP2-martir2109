# FED2-SP2-martir2109

Hello there! 👋🏼

My name is Martine Reppesgård Karlsen.

This is my Semester Project 2, submitted during my final year of Frontend Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

## 📋 Description

For this semester project we were given the task to create a web application using Noroff's Auction House API. The application allows users to register and log in, and interact with auction listings.

It is built using CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and communicates with the API via REST endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## Prototype

Before I started creating the actual web application, I designed a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. I followed the mobile-first approach and later created the desktop version.

🎯 Check out my Figma file: [Here](https://www.figma.com/design/DGiM5bAI54yJvhnbLuHO9I/FED2-SP2-Martine-R-Karlsen?node-id=1-3&t=S8ecdKG5xPkOvJuA-1)
